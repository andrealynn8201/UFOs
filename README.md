# UFO Analysis

## Overview

The purpose is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, whereby, allowing the users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results

In conjunction with the date criteria already in place, these search parameters were added:

* City
* State
* Country
* Shape

Adding this produced the final web page as seen here:

The user is able to enter whichever criteria they are looking for on the left, producing the results on the right.  When the user needs to change the criteria, they can either reload the page, or manually clear each field.

## Summary

Although the requested search criteria was added, a user is only able to filter the data with one search criteria at a time, such as only city, or only date.  

I would suggest further improving the search/filtering fields to significantly improve the experience, such as allowing the user to pick range of locations. This would allow the user to create a region instead of one specific city.  Another way it can be improved is to allow a person to narrow the search with dropdown filters. Once the object is selected in the first filter, a new filter appears to narrow down the search, based on that first filter. An example of this is picking out a car you want on a car search website. First itâ€™s the make, then the model, then the body style.  Once more data is compiled, it would be easier for someone to do their own research into UFOs and the specifics they are looking for.
